## Resources
Under the "resources" folder, a series of json files have been added which are based on various sources including the "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-declaration-completion-guide" and "CDS Codelists and WCO Reference".  

These are intended to be used to build UI elements such as select dropdown lists, radio buttons and other elements to assist users in completing declarations.  The data can also be used as part of validating the data entered.
